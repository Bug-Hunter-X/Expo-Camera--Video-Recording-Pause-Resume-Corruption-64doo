This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera controls.  Specifically, when trying to pause and resume video recording, the video might become corrupted or stop recording altogether without throwing any errors. This is particularly noticeable when using the `recordAsync` method and manipulating the `isRecording` state manually, rather than relying solely on Expo's built-in recording controls.
